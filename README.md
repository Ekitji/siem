# Offensive SIEM
Practical techniques for leveraging SIEM as an offensive discovery tool, helping defenders think like attackers to strengthen security from within.

## Queries
See above - queries.md file.

We dont spare any queries and are releasing all so
some new queries added ~ 18-19 september 2025.
Schtasks related with split for binary/argument, and system/administrator user and other event code for Schtasks.

## Ping us if/when you find something 
We hope that you liked the presentation. Ping us if you (i would say when you) find vulnerabilities by using this method. A simple message like "one of your queries cathed good stuff".. is more then enough :) do it by commiting to the ping.md file or contact us in alternative ways! We would be happy to share your success!

### General information
The repo will assist you in having offensive mindset. 

Repo is to share the material and queries that we talked about in our presentation:

#### Offensive SIEM - When The Blue Team Switches Perspective
‚≠ê https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nfL_4ek4dY

We have included the most interesting ACL related parts and have tips & tricks.

Check out the outstanding webinars about windows local privilege escalation and windows endpoint misconfigurations which will assist you further on. There are more areas to look into.. This is only the starting point. If you build good queries in other areas - please share it with us so more in the community can use them.

The queries with ‚≠ê mark is extra highly relevant.
The topics down below with ‚≠ê is really good content.

- https://www.absolomb.com/2018-01-26-Windows-Privilege-Escalation-Guide/ 

### Example of interesting areas to look into that we have not covered.
* weak passwords in command_line - that are not following best practices / policies
* weak passwords in registry  - that are not following best practices / policies
* AlwaysInstallElevated in Registry
* Windows Privileges - Look at 4672 (logon with special privileges) And 4704/4705 (assignment/removal of rights)
* Event code 5136 and 5137, AD objects.. look in to the fields: description, info and adminComment, if they have any plaintext passwords.
* Do not assume that Program Files and similar admin-protected directories always have correct ACLs (Access Control Lists). It does happen that applications set incorrect default permissions and are far too permissive. CWE-732, CWE-284, CWE-276
* etc..

### Other types of vulnerabilities
* Search in webserver logs for parameters (language=en.html) that shows file inclusion to test for LFI/RFI
* Search for application logs for SQL related errors that shows errors on bad charachters..
* AD attributes (example event.code:"5136" and Attribute:"msDS-KeyCredentialLink") that are commonly abused. Find misconfigurations and harden AD.
* Linux
etc.. etc..

### Software installed in C-root drive. ‚≠ê
Make a process creation query using event.code 1 from SYSMON OR event.code 4688 (or the event.codes for services, schedule tasks, DLL load from C-root subfolders)
Look for applications that are installed in C:\ root drive

##### example: 
          C:\myapplication\myapplication.exe
          C:\myapp\subfolder\myapp.exe
          C:\SoftwareCompany\software.exe
          C:\myapplication\myapplication.dll
          C:\myapp\subfolder\myapp.dll
          C:\SoftwareCompany\software.dll
               

The issue with applications that are installed in C-root folder is that it has per default incorrect ACL permissions which allows Authenticated Users to modify (M) the folder and possibly its files. If the Software installation does not correct the ACL in the installation process will likely result in a privilege escalation (confirm it) if a service or another high privileged process is spawning (ex. myapplication.exe OR myapp.exe) from one of the installation paths in C-roots subfolder.
#### Missed the chance of a Microsoft CVE - someone found it before: https://neodyme.io/en/advisories/cve-2025-47962/

### Services - use offensive mindset ‚≠ê
Gives you an idea of which event codes to use what you will see in the event code it self.
- https://detect.fyi/threat-hunting-suspicious-windows-service-names-2f0dceea204c

### Schedule taks - use offensive mindset ‚≠ê
#### Look for tasks running as SYSTEM or Administrator
Gives you and idea of which event codes to use and what you will see in the event code it self.
- https://www.thedfirspot.com/post/evil-on-schedule-investigating-malicious-windows-tasks

## Prerequisites
Well configured SYSMON config to catch events that are of interest, like event.code 1, 7, 11.
 - https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config
 - https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular

Enabled Advanced auditing for some of the Windows events.
For an example, process creation 4688 will likely need it to catch parent process name and not only the parent pid.

Scheduled task - 4698 is not enabled by default.


## ACL ‚≠ê
### üîπ Some Common ACL Principals Covering Logged-In Users

| Principal               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Everyone**             | All users, including Guests (and in older Windows versions, even Anonymous Logon). Very broad, usually restricted to read access. |
| **Authenticated Users**  | Any account that has successfully logged in (local or domain). Excludes anonymous users. |
| **BUILTIN\Users**        | The local **Users** group on the machine. Includes all standard (non-admin) local accounts. |
| **INTERACTIVE**          | Any user logged in **locally at the console** (keyboard/session). Useful for differentiating local vs. remote access. |
| **COMPUTERNAME\\Username** | A specific **local account** on that computer (e.g., `LAPTOP01\Bob`). Permissions apply only when that user logs on locally. |
| **DOMAIN\\Username**     | A specific **domain account** (e.g., `CORP\Alice`). Permissions follow the user across all domain-joined machines. |


### üìë ACL Attributes (Some Of The Interesting To Look Into)

Access Control List (ACL) attributes define what actions a user or group can perform on files or folders.  
Here are some key ones worth noting:

| Attribute | Name / Meaning           | Why It‚Äôs Interesting                                                                 |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **F**     | Full Access              | Grants **all possible rights** (read, write, execute, delete, change permissions, take ownership). Equivalent to "owner-level" control. |
| **M**     | Modify Access            | Allows reading, writing, and deleting files/folders, but **not changing ACLs** or ownership. Most common for regular users. |
| **W**     | Write-Only Access        | User can **create or modify content** but cannot read it back. Rare, but useful in "drop box" scenarios (e.g., secure file submissions). |
| **WD**    | Write Data / Add File    | Specifically allows **creating or writing to files in a directory**. Essential for being able to add or overwrite files inside a folder. |
| **AD**    | Append Data / Add Subdirectory | On files: append data to the end of a file (cannot overwrite). On folders: create new subdirectories inside. |


## Whitelisting
You will likely need to whitelist the queries. Make your hunt, fine tune the queries and make alerts of them to catch new events that you have not looked into.
##### Will likely need whitelisting:
      C:\ProgramData\Microsoft
      C:\ProgramData\Package Cache
      C:\ProgramData\Packages
      etc.


## Tips & Tricks
If a binary replacement is not possible because of correct ACL. Check folder permissions and if you have permissions to write files
check if the executable tries to load any dlls that do not exist. If so, create them and you have your code execution. If binary replacement is not possible because its a running process. Check possible DLL sideloading or check if you as a regular user have permissions to restart the service it self. Another way is to check if you as a regular user can perform a "shutdown" that you escape in last second. A shutdown initiation stops processes and if you break out from it, you may be able to replace the binary of the terminated process. If the service is in Autostart mode and you dont have permissions to start/stop the service, what you can check is if you have SeShutdownPrivilege and if so initiate a reboot with shutdown /r /t 0.

If a service is spawning the process and if its not possible to replace binary, the binary does not try to load any missing DLLs. Dont give up - maybe the path is unquoted and you have write permissions and you can use that?

Build your queries layer on layer.. so check for service/schedule task creations, check for the process creation with parent as services or schtasks. Its possible that some system creates the service or schedule task but the binary path etc does not exist and the process creation never happens. But the vulnerability is still there.

To reduce query load (performance) and probably whitelisting.. it may be a good idea to have queries separated for clients/servers. So a set of queries only used for the client endpoints and same set used for server endpoints.

The generic process creation by SYSTEM is high value query. It catches alot of scenarios.. besides of services and schtask spawning child processes it also catches msiexec.exe spawning a child process. It also caches if a executable from c:\windows\ccmcache is spawning a child process from a userwritable path. If we where to order executables in vulnerability i would still say that services.exe is related to software misconfigurations and schtasks is more a administrator misconfiguration..

If you have tried all queries and not got success.ful. if you want to hunt deeper, and do a litte bit more work - go for every child process of services.exe and schtasks.exe, regardles of where. Enumerate the enterprise and look for the ones in typical admin protected paths also (Program Files & Program Files (x86)). Its more common than you think that software vendors mess up the ACL even in typical protected paths.

## Uninstall processes
Its likely that if a user can trigger an installation, they can also trigger a uninstallation. Uninstall processes are of interest regardles of where the filepath is.
If the ACL is not correct - a binary replacement will likely cause trouble.
query also for file creation of typical uninstall files by using Sysmon event.code:11. 

### Example of uninstall process names
#### Common Generic Names

          uninstall.exe ‚Äì Most generic and widely used.
          unins000.exe, unins001.exe ‚Äì Common with Inno Setup installers.
          unwise.exe ‚Äì Often used by older Wise Installer packages.
          uninst.exe ‚Äì Shortened version, often found in legacy software.
          uninstaller.exe ‚Äì Slightly longer, descriptive variant.
          remove.exe ‚Äì Sometimes used for minimal installers.
          setup.exe (with /uninstall or /remove parameter) ‚Äì Some apps reuse the installer executable for uninstallation.
          appname_uninstall.exe (e.g., chrome_uninstall.exe)
          update.exe (with --uninstall) ‚Äì Seen with apps like Slack or Discord using Squirrel installers.

#### Patterns Worth Considering

          *_uninstall.exe ‚Äì Many apps prepend the app name, e.g., teams_uninstall.exe, zoom_uninstall.exe.
          *_cleanup.exe ‚Äì Removal tools often have cleanup variants, e.g., driver_cleanup.exe.
          *_remover.exe ‚Äì Another common AV/vendor naming style.
